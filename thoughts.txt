- impl/_GotmUserLocal seems useless? Ask for clarification maybe.

Notes:
- #warnings-disable does not work. They seemed to be in favor of removing: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/753#issuecomment-619533712 ... perhaps for the better?
- const dictionaries/arrays used to be shallow in Godot 3. This plugin utilized that fact to make the equivilant of "static variables" (i.e. _global in _GotmUtility). That is no longer the case: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71051. Using get/set meta instead as a hacky workaround...
- Do I need _impl in GotmUser??? Is there no better way to store private variables in objects? Currently there are no "private" vars or functions. Maybe it is needed...

Suggestions:
- move some _GotmScore functions to _GotmLeaderboard i.e. get_rank, list, list_by_rank, etc. I think it is better to decouple as much as possible.z
- implement Godot's new in-editor documentation feature wherever possible
