# Godot 4 Port Attempt

This is an attempt to port the current gotm plugin/addon.
Godot 4.0 recently released and the developers at gotm.io are currently trying to support it on their platform.
To accelerate the support with the plugin, and to personally get experince with the new gdscript language that has been overhauled, I decided to attempt porting to old plugin.

I will try to adhere to the official style guide here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html
